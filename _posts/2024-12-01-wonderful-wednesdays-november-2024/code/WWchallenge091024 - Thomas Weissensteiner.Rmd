### 1. Background and a "bad chart"  
<br>

"Wonderful Wednesdays" are a monthly webinar organised by the Visualisation Special Interest Group of Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry ([PSI](https://psiweb.org/)). This script was written for the VIS-SIG Wonderful Wednesdays challenge 10 Oct 24 (https://github.com/VIS-SIG/Wonderful-Wednesdays/tree/master/data/2024/2024-10-09). The task involved summary data of a randomized study, and consisted of suggesting a better visualisation than the chart that was provided. 

```{r libraries and data, warning = FALSE}

```

Additional information:  

* Data were from a randomized study comparing 8 treatments/interventions
* Subjects were followed up at 7 visits (X1 - X7), with the intervention given between visits 5 and 6
* The dataset contained mean scores by treatment and visit
* Endpoint was the Disease Index Score
* A "bad" chart:

The original data used numbers for both visits (1-7) as well as treatment groups (1-8). For better distinction in the chart, I changed the names of the treatment groups to upper case letters (A = 1, B = 2, ... H = 8). 

*"Mean Disease Index vs Visit" (left subplot)*  
Disease activity varied widely between groups and visits, in the periods before and after the intervention. There was a sharp rise in disease activity in group "G" after the intervention, and a notable drop in group "F". However, both of these trends seemed to have started already at visits 4 and 5.

*"Change following Intervention" (right subplot)*  
Nevertheless, I added a summary of mean disease index scores before and after intervention. My assumption was that visits 1-5 were meant to establish a baseline value, to which levels at visits 6 and 7 were to be compared. Treatment groups are shown in the order of their change in median values of their mean disease indices before and after intervention, from greatest decrease (group "F", left) to greatest increase (group "G", right).

In this version of the figure, I added two parameters that were not supplied with the example data but which might improve the figure.  

The first was a hypothetical target range for the disease index. The aim of treatment/intervention in this scenario would have been to keep index scores below the values in the shaded areas of the plots. For the assumed target here, the intervention achieved a meaningful benefit only in group "B", whereas group "G" became significantly worse.  

My second additional parameter were the intervals at which the visits were scheduled. This should give a better impression of the variability of the disease index over time, in particular if the visits were not evenly spaced.
<br>
<br>

### 3. Notes
<br>

There was no clear indication of a meaningful effect, except for a worsening of disease in group "G".
My difficulty with this task understanding the data, and what messages the figure should convey. 

Was the "intervention" given between visits 5 and 6 the initiation of treatments A-H? Or were these treatments started before the first visit, followed by an additional intervention that was identical for all groups?
If treatments were initiated between visits 5 and 6, and mean disease indices at prior visits represented the baselines for the supposedly randomised groups, their large variability should be a concern. Alternatively, the study could have been undertaken to assess the effect of a common intervention in patients on different treatments. However, there were no suggestions of this in the supplied "bad" figure.  

Redrawing the figure was further limited by having only basic summary data as a source, i.e., mean disease index scores with no confidence intervals. I compared the medians of the mean scores before and after "intervention", although an analysis of covariance would have been far more appropriate ^1^. However, this would have required patient-level data.
