# Seasonal plots

Time for something different! Can you create a seasonally-themed image?

The Challenge:

* It could be a winter scene or have a Christmas/Hanukkah theme
* Use the concept of layers (e.g. ggplot2) to build an image
* Can be static or animated
* Can use AI tools (e.g. Claude/ChatGPT) to develop code using a series of prompts


A description of the challenge can also be found [here](https://vis-sig.github.io/Wonderful-Wednesdays/data/2025/2025-11-12/).  
A recording of the session can be found [here](https://psiweb.org/vod/item/psi-vissig-wonderful-wednesday-69-seasonal-plot).

## Visualisation

<a id="example1"></a>

### Gestalt Principle #1: Proximity

<div class "layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body side">
<img align="right" src="images/snowman00.png" width="50%">
<i>“Elements that are close together are perceived as being related.”</i>
<br><br>
Mapping variables to X and Y dimensions in a scatter plot provide insights into related groups of data points. </div>

### Gestalt Principle #2: Similarity

<div class "layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body side">
<img align="right" src="images/snowman01.png" width="50%">
<i>“Elements that share visual characteristics like colour, size, or shape are perceived as belonging to the same group.”</i>
<br><br>
The data are grouped into categories, with each group mapped to a different shape/colour. 
<br><br>
The three points appearing close together belong to the same group, separated from the other groups.
</div>

### Gestalt Principle #3: Enclosure 

<div class "layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body side">
<img align="right" src="images/snowman02.png" width="50%">
<i>“Elements that are enclosed within a boundary, such as a border or a shaded region, are perceived as a group.”</i>
<br><br>
The graph is annotated to emphasis the two groups by use of enclosure.

</div>

<a id="example4"></a>

<div class "layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body side">
<img align="right" src="images/snowman03.png" width="50%">
Additional data points are added from a  fourth group, mapped to a white colour aesthetic. These data appear to have a random pattern.

</div>

### Gestalt Principle #4: Figure–Ground

<div class "layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body side">
<img align="right" src="images/snowman04.png" width="50%">
<i>“The mind distinguishes between objects in the foreground (figure) and the background (ground).”</i>
<br><br>
Filling the circular enclosures separates the original data points from the unstructured data.

</div>

### Gestalt Principle #5 : Common Fate

<div class "layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body side">
<img align="right" src="images/snowman05.gif" width="50%">
<i>“Elements that move or change together are perceived as related.”</i>
<br><br>
Data mapped to white symbols form a time series, and animation is used to show evolution over time.

</div>

### Gestalt Principle #6: Prägnanz 

<div class "layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body side">
<img align="right" src="images/snowman06.gif" width="50%">
Prägnanz is a German word that means “pithiness” or “concise and meaningful”.
<br><br>
We can apply this principle by removing unnecessary graph elements.
<br><br>
We also add a title with a clear message!

### Christmas customs prompting

I (Thomas) used Claude.ai, Sonnet 4.5. to generate this graph. Claude's response is [christmas-knowledge-graph_prototype.html](christmas-knowledge-graph_prototype-Thomas_Weissensteiner.html).
A lot of editing and tweaking eventually led to [christmas-knowledge-graph_improved.html](christmas-knowledge-graph_improved-Thomas_Weissensteiner.html). Because I overran the limits for an individual conversation, I had to restart the thread. I usually use this to ask Claude to check the code for any "clutter" that might have accumulated during previous iterations.

<b>Initial prompt</b>

I would like to generate an interactive knowledge graph. The theme is popular Christmas traditions around the world, their historical origins, relationships with each other, and other contemporary customs.
Interactive features could include 
* links to online information when the cursor hovers of a node
* options to customise the graph: selecting node categories (persons, places, traditions, etc.), changing edge distance, etc.
Please 
* add suggestions for content and visualisation (bullet point list, minimal details)
* sketch a strategy for implementation, including programming language(s) and packages best suited for the task, and a bullet-point outline of the essential tasks involved in building the knowledge graph

<b>Prompt initiating the follow-up thread</b>

I would like to generate an interactive knowledge graph. 
[..., as above]
Attached is a draft version. Please check the code for robustness and efficiency. Remove any parts that are obsolete and suggest improvements.
