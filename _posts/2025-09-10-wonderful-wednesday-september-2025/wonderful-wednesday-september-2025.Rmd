# Fatty liver disease

The Background:

There is a recent publication: The Effect of Liv.52 DS in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD): A Pilot, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Clinical Study

The publication is available via (NIH)[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40765845/].

In this publication a pair of figures has been attached, that is the basis of the discussion on graphic design principles.

Data set:

- 47 eligible subjects randomised 2:1 to active treatment or placebo
- LSM score measured at baseline and end of study after 6 months
- State of steatosis
- patient level data was simulated to match the displayed results

The Challenge:

Within the publication the below plots were present. This months challenge was to improve a plot or find a better way to visually present the data.

Mean Change in LSM values (kPa). Comparisons between the groups were performed using unpaired t-tests. Data were collected after six months of randomization.
